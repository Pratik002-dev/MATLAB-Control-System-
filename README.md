(1). Here, We are performing calculation of Continuous time transfer function value and its result graph visualisation for Response Vs Time for 6 different values of zeta (Damping ratio) and settling time range 
t=0:0.01:12;

(2). In 2nd part, we are performing calculation of Continuous time transfer function value and its result graph of Step response (Response vs time) for fixed value of zeta(Damping ratio),Damped Natural frequency, peak and rise time, Maximum overshoot etc.
